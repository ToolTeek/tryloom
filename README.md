== Support ==

For support, visit [TryLoom Support](https://gettryloom.com/support) or open an issue on the WordPress plugin forum.

== Privacy ==

This plugin handles user-uploaded images with care.  
Images are processed via a secure API and stored only as configured.  
Ensure your site’s privacy policy covers image uploads and processing.  
The plugin does **not share data with third parties** beyond the API used for generation.

== External Services (API) ==

This plugin relies on the **TryLoom Cloud Platform** (maintained by ToolTeek) to function.
Because AI image generation requires significant computational resources, it cannot run directly on your WordPress hosting environment. Instead, user images and product data are sent to our secure cloud infrastructure for processing and the result is returned to your site.
