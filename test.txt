here is my soltuion. it trigger when admin loads tryloom settings page and status is blocked. this solve problem for active clients. for sleep cliets it has heartbeat cron for 12 hours. it checks every 12 hour. if any user not came to visit website doe 2 days it doen't run. but it doesn't matter there is no one to see it. and when any user visit website it runs cron and activate plugin. now i need to know this. think of next cron will scheduled to run at 12 a.m. since that site is low traffic it wasn't run at 12 a.m but at 2a.m one user arrives. does it now run's or wait for 12 p.m?
